# Here Be Dragons

## Breath Attacks
A dragon's breath attack is based on what mineral predominantly made up its diet as a hatchling. A dragon's appearance and behaviour differs depending on what its breath attack is.

## Mechanics
- [ ] Dragons have 3 stages of growth: Hatchling, Adolescent, and Adult
  - [ ] When a dragon grows up, it sheds its scales, allowing the player to obtain them for armour
  - [ ] Scales from one type of dragon only resist the breath attack of the same type of dragon (i.e. a lightning dragon only resists lightning and not fire)
