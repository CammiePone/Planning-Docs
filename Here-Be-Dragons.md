## Mechanics
- [ ] Dragons have 3 stages of growth: Hatchling, Adolescent, and Adult
  - [ ] When a dragon grows up, it sheds its scales, allowing the player to obtain them for armour
  - [ ] Dragon scale armour resists all dragon breath attack effects by 50% if wearing the full set, but is only equal to iron in terms of protection
- [ ] Only wild dragons are able to lay eggs. Dragons hatched by a player will be unable to lay eggs
