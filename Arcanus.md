# Arcanus 2

## Casting System
- [ ] Casting is handled by selecting a spell in a radial menu, setting the player's Spell Charge to the selected spell.
  - [ ] The player's Spell Charge will display at the bottom right side of the screen.
  - [ ] The player can open the spell selection screen by holding Right Click while holding a wand, and select a spell by mousing over it and letting go of Right Click.
  - [ ] The player can cast their Spell Charge by Left Clicking.
- [ ] Spells have 3 levels of complexity, each consuming a certain amount of aura:
  - [ ] Simple (1 aura)
  - [ ] Intricate (2 aura)
  - [ ] Complex (3 aura)
- [ ] There are also Unique spells, who will completely drain a player's Aura over time. How fast it drains depends on the spell.

## Research System
- [ ] Research is done by giving players a 6-dot grid in the shape of a pentagon with one dot in the middle, representing the Aura Diagram abstractly. The player is also provided with a 6 line riddle, where each line describes one of the Aura Types. Connecting the dots in the order provided by the riddle will complete the research.
  - [ ] To make it easier to connect the dots, so to speak, there will be an Aura Diagram behind the riddle text as decoration on the book's page.
  - [ ] Doubles as a way to get players familiar with the Aura Types so when they want to suggest spells, I don't have to tell people that the spell they're suggesting doesn't fit the category they think it fits.
