## Mana
Mana is a term to describe multiple types of energy that flow through ley lines in the player's body, and are utilised for magic. The player starts off with anywhere between 3-10 mana (based on the player's UUID + world seed) in each of the four types, but this number can be increased through certain actions (TBD).

If you have too much of one type of mana relative to its opposite, there will be negative effects induced upon the player.

## Burnout
Burnout is a negative energy that will fill the player's ley lines, resulting in a lower yield of mana, and will remain there until removed. Burnout is only gotten when you try and cast a spell without having enough of the required mana, resulting in an imbalance in energies.

This also causes damage to the player, relative to their maximum health. For example, if you take 20% burnout of your maximum mana in one type, you will take 20% of your health as damage. If you take 20% of your maximum mana in two types, you will take 40% damage.

## Casting
Spell casting is done by using a pattern (right and left) associated with a given spell slot on the player. The player has 8 spell slots available to them. Each spell consumes some amount of mana, depending on what components they used. Each component is associated with each mana type.

## Spellcraft
I'll explain spellcraft later, gtg for now and I wanna save what I have for now.
