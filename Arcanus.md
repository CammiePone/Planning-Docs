## Mana
Mana is a term to describe multiple fluids in the body utilised for casting magic. The player starts off with only 5 mana in each of the four types, but this number can be increased through certain actions (TBD).

## Burnout
Burnout is tied to another fluid, blood. It displaces the mana fluids, resulting in a lower yield of mana, and will remain there until removed. Burnout is only gotten when you try and cast a spell without having enough of the required mana, resulting in a tear that allows blood in.

This also causes damage to the player, relative to their maximum health. For example, if you take 20% burnout of your maximum mana in one type, you will take 20% of your health as damage. If you take 20% of your maximum mana in two types, you will take 40% damage.

## Casting
Spell casting is done by using a pattern (right and left) associated with a given spell slot on the player. The player has 8 spell slots available to them. Each spell consumes some amount of mana, depending on what components they used. Each component is associated with each mana type.
