# Localised Weather

## Overworld Weather
- [ ] Rain/Snow
  - It's just rain/snow. You know how it works
- [ ] Fog
  - Fog that obscures vision within it
- [ ] Sandstorms
  - Spicy fog (only hapoens in deserts)
- [ ] Hail
  - Spicy snow

## Nether Weather
- [ ] Soul Storms
  - Idk what it'd do yet, but it sounds cool (only happens in Soul Sand Valleys)
- [ ] Ashen Winds
  - Embers and ash since your skin and lungs (only happens in Lava Lakes and Basalt Deltas)

## End Weather
- [ ] Ender Fog
  - Dense fog that randomly turns the player around

## Weather Severity
Weather has 3 levels of severity that impacts how it displays and affects players. For instance, level 1 of rain would just be a light drizzle, while level 3 would be thunderstorms.

## Weather Behaviour
Weather will spawn near players occasionally, but only 1 storm can be in the area already. It will also move around randomly by selecting a spot in its radius to move towards, before selecting a new location. If it passes certain biome borders, it may change its appearance and behaviour some, such as rain entering a very cold biome turning into snow.
