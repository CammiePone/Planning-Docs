# Random Game Idea #5526

## World
- open world, but the map will be small
- densely packed with things to uncover and explore
- probably no, or few, side quests
- looming threat that constantly shifts its position over the map

## Story
- has the player explore the entire world over time
- maybe unlocks airships if we wanna still do that halfway through as a kinda fast travel
- bold of you to assume I have anything more specific than that right now

## Mechanics
- we got single-shot guns, we got swords, we got spell cards. what more do you want? /s

<sub>look I'm super tired and cant be assed to flesh this out much more right now, I'll do it later</sub>
