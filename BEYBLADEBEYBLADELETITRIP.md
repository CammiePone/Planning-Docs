## Controls
- ðŸ”´ The entire game can be controlled without the use of a controller, instead using the body to create inputs
  - Crouch to increase top's torque to keep it spinning
  - Lean in the direction you want to go
  - Jump to make the top jump
- ðŸŸ¡ There would be controller support, but for the most part, the focus will be on the controls that don't use a controller

## Gameplay
- ðŸ”´ When players bump into each other, they get bumped in the opposite direction with an equal force
- ðŸ”´ There would be hazards around the map - some active, some not - that will randomly switch to a different random hazard, or go inactive, during the match

## Hazards
- ðŸ”´ **Sand Trap** - slows tops down quickly
- ðŸ”´ **Bumper** - gives a large amount of velocity to players in the direction they face
- ðŸ”´ **Pit** - has tracks that can be grabbed on to by the top get out of
- ðŸ”´ **Raised Platform** - will knock players off their top, instantly eliminating them
- ðŸ”´ **Wall** - it's just a wall you can bump into, some will have tracks and can be different shapes

## Helpers (idfk dude Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\_\/Â¯)
- ðŸ”´ **Wall Track** - can be latched onto by the sides of tops, allowing players to ride on walls. Players can also jump off of them and onto other tracks or onto the ground
- ðŸŸ¢ **Sticks** - useful for batting at other players to reduce their torque
- ðŸŸ¢ **Slippery Jelly** - throwable that creates a patch of extra slippery ground that makes it hard to control while on top of

## Gamemodes
- ðŸ”´ **Last Man Spinning** - a free-for-all gamemode where whoever is the last player with their top still spinning wins the match. The goal of the gamemode is to eliminate other players by any means necessary to ensure you're the last one standing
- ðŸŸ¡ **Capture The Flag** - 
- ðŸŸ¢ **Team Deathmatch** - 
- ðŸŸ¢ **BÃ¶ll** - basketball, but without dribbling and on tops. You can pass the ball to teammates, but if you get bumped, or hit a hazard, you drop the ball. Other players can also swipe the ball right out of your hands if they get close enough. The ball itself is significantly larger than a basketball, and bumping into it while it's on the ground will knock it into the air for you to grab

## Priority
- ðŸ”´ - High Priority
- ðŸŸ¡ - Medium Priority
- ðŸŸ¢ - Low Priority
