## Spirit Pools
- Found underground in Dripstone Caves below stalactites
- Can also be created by exposing water to the Moon and having it drip through a Dripstone Stalactite into a cauldron
- Have special properties when exposed to the Full Moon
  - When an Amethyst Shard is tossed into a 5x2x5 Spirit Pool, the Amethyst Shard will float in the middle, absorbing the energy from the Spirit Pool, slowly turning it into water
  - The resulting Imbued Amethyst Shard can then be in tune with the Moon and the Spirits, allowing it to act as a magical catalyst
