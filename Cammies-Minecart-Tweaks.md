## Minecarts
- [x] Can be linked together by a chain.
- [x] Minecarts going fast will deal 10 damage.

## Furnace Minecarts
- [x] 300% faster when powered by Coal or Charcoal (50% faster than regular Minecarts on Powered Rails).
- [x] Come to a complete stop (and consume all their fuel fully) when on inactive Powered Rails.
